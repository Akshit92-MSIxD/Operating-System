==> WHAT IF THERE IS NO OS ?

-- Resource Exploitation (ek app hi pura system ke resources pe apna adhikar jama lega aur baaki apps ko chalne ka moka hi ni dega :( )
  Note : Resources can be of two types => HR(CPU,Memory,Hard Disk,Input Devices etc) , SR(Language Translators,Drivers etc)

-- Manual Resource Management would be done (Developers ko khud se RM ka code likhna padega App S/W ke liye) ==> Bulky apps!!!

-- DRY principle violation (Dont Repeat Yourself) [RM aur MM ka code har app ke liye likhna padega ==> RM aur MM ka code repeat hoga :( ]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==> WHY OS IS NECESSARY IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM ? 

-- (System Software Khaandan ka BADA BETA :)

-- Provides a Platform/Interface to the developers/App S/W to execute without bothering about the complexity of CS.

-- Resource Management [har app s/w ko efficiently resource allocate krega taaki wo bura na mane :)]

-- No Bulky Apps [Os contains code for RM , MM , PM , Scheduling etc :)] [Mast malloc calloc use kro baaki memory kaha allocate hogi wo sab OS bhai sambhal lega :)]

-- Provides Isolation and Protection to individual App S/w [ so that other App S/W do not read/write data from the memory allocated to other App S/W during execution]

-- No Security Violation [ Isolation : each App S/W is allocated memory at different place in RAM and is unaware about the presence of other App S/W running in the RAM during execution :)]

-- Memory Management

-- Software Management [ App S/W , System S/W(OS ki Family :), Utility S/W]

-- Provide Decent Security

-- Abstraction [hides the underlying complexity of the Computer System]

-- Communicator with Hardware

==> OS defination

-- OS is a type of System Software which provides a interface between a user and computer hardware.
-- OS communicates with H/W on behalf of a user/App-S/W
