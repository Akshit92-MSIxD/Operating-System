==> GOALS OF OS :

--> Max CPU Utilization [CPU ko idle nahi bethne dena , agar koi process P1 I/O krne chale gyi to P2 process ko execute kre CPU bus khali na bethe]

--> No Process Starvation [Saari process jo RAM mai hai unhe  execute hone ka moka mile]
    ex of process starvation : agar P1 = while(true){....} then P1 will execute for infinite time and other processes will not get time to execute :(

--> Higher Priority Job Execution [ Jo process higher priority rakhta to usko sabse pehle execute krdo baaki saari process ko execute mat kro]
    ex : Antivirus scan for external drive must be given highest priority!!!
    Note : if P1 is executing on CPU  and a higher priority Process P2 comes then P1 execution will be stopped immediately and CPU will be scheduled to P2 :)
